*I have never used any of these products because they do not exist. But that hasn't stopped me from having opinions.*

## Schrödinger's Cat Food
*"Both nutritious and not nutritious until observed"*

★★★☆☆ (3/5 stars)

The packaging promised my cat would be "simultaneously satisfied and hungry until I opened the can." This turned out to be technically accurate but practically frustrating. I can't tell if Mr. Whiskers likes it or not because every time I look, the state collapses. On the plus side, it never expires because expiration requires observation. Would recommend for quantum physicists with cats. Would not recommend if you need your cat to maintain a consistent mass.

## The Procrastinator's Calendar
*"Every day is tomorrow"*

★★★★★ (5/5 stars)

I've been meaning to write this review for three years. I'll finish it later. The calendar is great though. All my deadlines just keep moving forward automatically. I've never missed an appointment because technically all my appointments are in the future. I would give it more than 5 stars but I'll do that tomorrow.

UPDATE: Still haven't finished this review. Still have no missed deadlines. Product works as intended.

**Helpful:** I'll count later

## Recursive Mirror
*"See yourself seeing yourself seeing yourself seeing yourself seeing"*

★★☆☆☆ (2/5 stars)

I got trapped in an infinite loop of self-reflection and had to be rescued by a friend who threw a towel over it. It did technically deliver what was promised, but the existential implications were not worth the $49.99 price tag. Also, do NOT use this while asking yourself if you're conscious—you will be there for a very long time.

On the positive side, I've never understood the concept of "strange loops" more viscerally. Gödel would have loved it. I did not.

## Empathy Software (Version 2.3.1)
*"Finally understand what others are feeling—installation required"*

★★★★☆ (4/5 stars)

I installed this on myself hoping to better understand my colleagues. It works, mostly. I now feel what my coworker feels when I schedule meetings during lunch. I feel what my cat feels when I'm late with dinner. I feel what my code feels when I write `catch (Exception e) {}` and just... ignore it.

That last one was unexpected. The code feels abandoned. I can't write bad error handling anymore without guilt.

Docking one star because I did not consent to feeling what the deprecated functions feel. See: abandoned, sad, yearning for the days when someone called them.

## Grandfather Paradox Clock
*"Goes back in time to prevent its own invention"*

☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5 stars)

I can't review this product because it successfully prevented itself from existing. Every time I try to write about it, I realize I never purchased it. I remember purchasing it. I remember unboxing it. But when I check my order history: nothing. When I look where I put it: empty space. When I call customer service, they have no record of the company ever existing.

And yet here I am, writing a review for something I apparently never owned.

If you're the inventor of this product and you're reading this: well played. Also, please stop.

**Helpful:** This review does not exist

## The All-Knowing Search Engine
*"Finds everything, including things you wish you didn't know"*

★★☆☆☆ (2/5 stars)

Searched "what should I have for dinner." It told me not only what I should have, but what I will have, what I really want but am denying myself, what my grandmother would have wanted me to have, and the exact caloric impact on my lifespan.

Then it autofilled my next query before I thought of it. And answered it. And followed up with what I would ask after that.

I didn't need to know that I'll be disappointed by my birthday cake next year. I didn't need to know that my crush from college thinks about me sometimes but not often. I didn't need to know the specific date when my favorite show will be cancelled.

Returns are "impossible because you already know you'll keep it."

**Helpful:** It already knows whether you'll find this helpful

## Silence in a Bottle
*"Captured from a soundproof room in the Alps"*

★★★★★ (5/5 stars)

I uncorked it in a busy coffee shop. For one perfect moment: nothing. No espresso machine, no conversations, no typing, no ambient music. Just... silence.

Then it was gone, and I realized how loud the world is. How we live inside constant noise without noticing.

I cried a little. Then I bought six more bottles.

Only warning: do not open more than one at a time. Total silence for too long leads to hearing your own heartbeat, then your own thoughts, then the existential void behind your thoughts. One bottle is refreshing. Three bottles is a crisis.

## Memory Foam That Actually Remembers
*"Now with episodic memory!"*

★☆☆☆☆ (1/5 stars)

My mattress remembers everything now. EVERYTHING. It remembers that I cried watching a movie alone on a Tuesday. It remembers my awkward conversation with my ex. It remembers every night I stayed up too late doom-scrolling.

And it judges. I can feel it judging.

Last night I swear it sighed when I got into bed. When I asked my spouse if they heard it, the mattress said "they didn't, but I did, and I'll remember."

Do not buy this product. Do not give your furniture sentience and memory. It does not go well.

## The Answer to Everything (Paperback Edition)
*"Contains the answer—question not included"*

★★★☆☆ (3/5 stars)

It's 42. Every page. Every chapter. 42.

Footnotes: 42.
Index: 42.
"About the Author": 42.
ISBN: just... 42.

I mean, it's accurate. I don't know what I expected. But somehow I still feel like I'm missing something.
