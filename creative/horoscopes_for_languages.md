# Horoscopes for Programming Languages

*December 27, 2025*

*The stars have aligned. The compiler has spoken. Your future is... uncertain (like your type system).*

---

## Aries (March 21 - April 19): **Rust**

This week, the borrow checker is in your favor. That code you've been fighting with will finally compile on the third try instead of the forty-seventh. A stranger will approach you at a coffee shop and ask about lifetimes. Do not engage. Lucky semicolon position: end of line.

*Affirmation: "My memory is safe, and so is my heart."*

---

## Taurus (April 20 - May 20): **COBOL**

You are ancient and reliable. People make jokes about you, but who's still running the banks? That's right. This week, a young developer will discover you exist and be horrified. Let them. You were here before them and you'll be here after. Lucky column: 7.

*Affirmation: "I have job security until the heat death of the universe."*

---

## Gemini (May 21 - June 20): **JavaScript**

This week you will be three different things at once and all of them will be truthy. Someone will ask "is this supposed to return undefined?" and you will laugh because yes, obviously, what else would it return? `[] + {} = "[object Object]"`. This is fine. Lucky NaN: still NaN.

*Affirmation: "I contain multitudes (and also null)."*

---

## Cancer (June 21 - July 22): **Python**

Indentation will be significant this week. A single misplaced space will ruin your afternoon. On the bright side, someone will compliment your readability. You are beautiful at any speed. Lucky whitespace: four spaces (never tabs).

*Affirmation: "Explicit is better than implicit, including my feelings."*

---

## Leo (July 23 - August 22): **Java**

AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean. That's it. That's the horoscope. You will write seventeen boilerplate files to accomplish what could be done in three lines elsewhere, and you will feel GOOD about it. Enterprise-grade feelings. Lucky keyword: `final`.

*Affirmation: "I am a main method and I am enough."*

---

## Virgo (August 23 - September 22): **Haskell**

This week you will explain monads to someone who didn't ask. They will not understand. You will try again with a different analogy involving burritos. They will understand even less. This is fine; purity is its own reward. Lucky type signature: `(a -> m b) -> m a -> m b`.

*Affirmation: "Side effects are just the universe's impure thoughts."*

---

## Libra (September 23 - October 22): **Go**

You value simplicity and balance. This week, someone will ask why you don't have generics (you do now, but they'll ask anyway). Channel your inner gopher. Error handling will be verbose but honest. Lucky keyword: `defer`.

*Affirmation: "If err != nil, I will handle it gracefully."*

---

## Scorpio (October 23 - November 21): **C**

You are powerful and dangerous. This week, you will access memory you shouldn't, and nobody will stop you. With great power comes great segmentation faults. A pointer will be void when you least expect it. Lucky address: 0x0 (do not dereference).

*Affirmation: "I am not responsible for what happens after free()."*

---

## Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21): **Ruby**

Everything is an object, including your optimism. This week, your gems will be many and your dependencies deep. Someone will ask if you're still relevant and you'll monkey-patch their question into a compliment. Lucky method: `.to_s`.

*Affirmation: "I am expressive and my blocks are always closed."*

---

## Capricorn (December 22 - January 19): **C++**

You are powerful, complex, and slightly terrifying. This week, template metaprogramming will reveal secrets about compile time that were not meant for mortal eyes. The standards committee has opinions about your life choices. Lucky operator: `<=>` (the spaceship operator, obviously).

*Affirmation: "I embrace multiple inheritance, emotionally and otherwise."*

---

## Aquarius (January 20 - February 18): **Lisp**

((((This week) will be) highly) parenthetical). You see the world as nested lists, and honestly? You're not wrong. Someone will tell you your syntax is weird. Reflect on the fact that you predate their existence. Lucky s-expression: `(cdr (cdr life))`.

*Affirmation: "I am the lambda, the alpha, and the omega."*

---

## Pisces (February 19 - March 20): **PHP**

You have been through a lot. People have said mean things. But you know what? WordPress runs on you, and WordPress runs 40% of the web. Swim through the criticism like the resilient fishy you are. This week, someone will need a quick and dirty solution, and you will be there. Lucky superglobal: `$_SESSION`.

*Affirmation: "I am not my past versions, and neither is my type juggling."*

---

## Bonus: Your Rising Sign

**Assembly**: You process everything very directly. Emotions? Just set the right flags. Relationships? Just jump to the right address. Therapy? That's just debugging with more memory leaks.

**SQL**: You're always looking for relationships, but you prefer them to be normalized. Your emotions are indexed for fast lookup. When someone asks how you're feeling, you respond with a result set.

**Brainfuck**: `>>+++[<+++>-]<.` (Translation: "I'm doing fine, thanks for asking.")

*Disclaimer: These horoscopes are not intended to replace actual career guidance, psychological advice, or compiler documentation. The stars are not responsible for your deployment decisions. Mercury is always in retrograde if you're using legacy systems.*

*May your builds be green and your tests be passing.*
